the development of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> social</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> attachments attachments</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in infancy . it is suggested that the core of the attachment

 results indicate that the age at onset of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> specific attachments</SIGN_SYMPTOM> is

 this is preceded by a phase of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> indiscriminate attachment behavior specific attachment</SIGN_SYMPTOM> increases most in the<DATE> first month following onset</DATE> and that thereafter fluctuations occur in individual 
 cases which make long-term prediction difficult,. and that<SIGN_SYMPTOM> multiplicity of objects</SIGN_SYMPTOM> can be found in some instances at the very<DATE> beginning soon thereafter</DATE> . correlations between the attachment 
 variables, as well as with the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> fear-of-strangers</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> measure, are presented, 
 and an examination is also made of the conditions eliciting protest at 
 proximity<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> loss</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>, of the manner in which protest is expressed, and of the 
 conditions necessary to terminate protest . 
 individual differences with regard to the three main parameters were 
 explored in a subgroup of 36 infants . a number of variables were 
 examined in relation to these individual differences, and suggestions 
 made regarding the conditions which affect the manifestation of the 
 attachment function . 
 the data are discussed in relation to four themes which emerged from 
 the findings.. the nature of the attachment function, its developmental 
 origins, its developmental trends, and the influence of the social

<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE>maternal separation</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> in the<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> rhesus</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> monkey .

 other<SIGN_SYMPTOM> complex social</SIGN_SYMPTOM><DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> behaviors</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> while separated . 
 it is clear that<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> infantmother</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> separation produces<SIGN_SYMPTOM> emotional disturbance</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns of 
 responses following separation are similar in both species . the results 
 obtained in studies of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> monkey infantmother</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> separation indicate that 
 sheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separation 
 for monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation from 
 the mother are vitally important for human children, and may account in 
 part for the absence or rarity of the<SIGN_SYMPTOM> detachment</SIGN_SYMPTOM> stage (as seen in human 
 response pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results show 
 considerable similarity in the responses of human children and infant 
 monkeys to separation from the mother .

 2. attention is drawn to the difficulties arising from lack of 
 differentiation between the concrete gnostic body image and the abstract 
 verbal body image in investigation of these patients . the<DISEASE_DISORDER> aphasic syndrome</DISEASE_DISORDER> should be differentiated from disturbances of g<SIGN_SYMPTOM>nosis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> by 
 application of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> separate, non-verbal methods</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> of testing to elicit the 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> impairment</SIGN_SYMPTOM> of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> gnostic body image</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> . the latter may be well 
 compensated for and it is apparently unimpaired in the presence of an 
<DISEASE_DISORDER> aphasic syndrome</DISEASE_DISORDER> limited to the verbal body image .

 presented here) . if the<DISEASE_DISORDER> aphasic syndrome</DISEASE_DISORDER> is subsiding,<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> finger</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><DISEASE_DISORDER> aphasia</DISEASE_DISORDER>

<DISEASE_DISORDER> acalculiastmanngno</DISEASE_DISORDER>sia/ may 
 represent a partial impairment of the verbal body image and be limited 
 to finger aphasia . 
 4. it is assumed that the verbal body image differs from other 
 categories of verbal symbols owing to the mainly proprioceptive, 
 vestibular and tactile experience forming its specific physiologic 
 background . telereceptive experience is of minor importance in the 
 initial development of the understanding of words defining the body 
 image . 
 in the patients described here, the selectively worse aphasic 
 impairment of the verbal body image, as compared with other categories 
 of words, seem to confirm this assumption .

 this must bear in mind that patients suffering<DISEASE_DISORDER> cerebral insult</DISEASE_DISORDER> are 
 usually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they develop 
 new habit<SIGN_SYMPTOM> patterns</SIGN_SYMPTOM> slowly and regression often will follow apparent

psychology of children's<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> dental</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> treatment . 
 the communication deals with influences involved in the development of 
 the child's attitude to dental treatment . they are extrinsic 
 (educational etc.) and intrinsic (constitutional and hereditary) . their 
 understanding helps to determine the correct psychological policy for 
 the management of the child in the surgery . 
 the aim of psychology applied in dentistry is to discover a mode of 
 treatment procedure which would ensure that the child will not be 
 subject to any psychic<DISEASE_DISORDER> traumatizationphyl</DISEASE_DISORDER>axis) . its second aim 
 is the management of the so called difficult child and his treatment . 
 to understand better the child's frame of mind during dental treatment 
 the situation in the surgery is dealt with step by step as the child 
 experiences it through his senses and his<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> psyche</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> . beside the basic 
 senses -dash<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> hearing seeing</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> -dash others are also affected..<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> touchpressure</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> sensation smell taste</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> . 
 children during dental treatment are nearly always in a state of 
 raised<SIGN_SYMPTOM> emotional tension anxiety reactions</SIGN_SYMPTOM> . 
 according to the degree of fear which they manifest children may be 
 classed into categories of cooperating and difficult patients . the 
 psychological procedure for the treatment of children of both groups is 
 based on the principles summarized in the section 'psychophylaxis in 
 dentistry' . in difficult children it is often necessary to employ yet 
 other psychological measures-<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE>psychotherapy suggestion</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> etc . in 
 extremely exacting cases<MEDICATION> premedication</MEDICATION> helps sometimes to find contact 
 with the child . 
 the experimental part of the work demonstrates the following findings 
 1. dental treatment consists of a series of interdependent 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> traumatizing impulses</SIGN_SYMPTOM> . many of them appear only after a close analysis 
 of the situation . 2. the adverse response similar to that elicited by 
 pain may be due also to sensory impressions with a negative emotional 
 background . 3. psychic traumatization of the child during dental 
 treatment can be prevented by relatively simple psychological measures .

 this paper is not intended as an exhaustive review of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> bilirubin</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> 
 metabolism nor of the many factors which may result in exaggerated

<MEDICATION> vitamin k derivatives sulfasoxazole (gantrisin salicylates novobiocin</MEDICATION> have been unequivocally shown to affect adversely the newborn 
 infant's ability to handle bilirubin . in time other compounds will 
 definitely be incriminated . 
 it is important to remember that the administration of a drug to a 
 mother just prior to delivery may result in appreciable concentrations 
 of the compound in the infant's serum, and that drugs administered to 
 the nursing mother may be excreted in breast milk and thereby absorbed 
 by the infant . careful consideration of the drugs given not only to the 
 newborn but also to the mother is therefore essential if we are to avoid 
 what may be termed iatrogenic hyper<DISEASE_DISORDER>bili</DISEASE_DISORDER>rubinemia .

<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE>amputation</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> in patients over<AGE> 80 years of age</AGE> . 
 although patients over 80 years of age can be expected to have poor

 that nevertheless they can be subjected to surgical procedures without 
 undue mortality . the mortality rate can be maintained at a minimum if 
 the surgeon considers the factors that contribute to its increase in the 
 elderly . this necessitates.. 1) careful evaluation of the patient and 
 treatment of any pre-existing or co-existing disease, 2) proper control 
 of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> electrolytes</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>, 3) avoidance of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> infection hypotension</SIGN_SYMPTOM>, 5) postoperative<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> pulmonary ventilation</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> and

 these experiments do not demonstrate any large-scale influx of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> small lymphocytes</SIGN_SYMPTOM> from the blood<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> stream marrow parenchyma</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> . they 
 suggest that newly formed<SIGN_SYMPTOM> small lymphocytes</SIGN_SYMPTOM> appear in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> marrow</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> as a 
 result of the division of locally situated precursor cells, but the 
 mechanism of intramedullary lymphocytopoiesis is uncertain .

 certain large, undifferentiated labeled<SIGN_SYMPTOM> cells</SIGN_SYMPTOM> appeared in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> bone marrow</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> as a result of hematogenous migration . some implications of

 since an<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> ostium primum</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> defect</SIGN_SYMPTOM> requires<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> cardio-pulmonary bypass</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> for its 
 closure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirable 
 in the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedure 
 itself . 
 the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriate 
 diagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in the

 in summary, the authors have attempted 
 to bring together the multiple observations 
 which seem germane to the understanding 
 of surface phenomena in lungs in health 
 and disease.  to this end, the contributions 
 of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> anatom pathologists</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> on the 
 fine structure of<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> alveolar cells</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and their 
 lining are fundamental.  the concepts of 
 alveolar stability required the special 
 insights of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> physiologist chemists</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> became significant as 
 methods of identification and assay of the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> al veolar lining</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> material were of interest. 
 clinicians asked what relevance these studies 
 had to<DISEASE_DISORDER> atelectasisac- tant premature</DISEASE_DISORDER> infants. 
 students of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> metabolism</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> began to focus on 
 the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> lung</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> as a site of phospholipid synthesis, 
 and their tools seem most promising at 
 this time in unearthing possible errors in 
 metabolism which may express themselves

 whether the increase of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> unesteri- fied fatty acids</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cord blood</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> which takes place

 brought about a greater decrease

<MEDICATION> glucose glucose insulin</MEDICATION>, an<LAB_VALUE> increase</LAB_VALUE> in the values 
 of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> lactic pyruvic acid</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> took place 
 in the parturient women; this was probably due 
 to an accelerated glycolysis and an 
 increased production of lactic<SIGN_SYMPTOM> acid</SIGN_SYMPTOM>, but not 
 caused by a higher share of the anaerobic 
 metabolism.  in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cord blood</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>, there were 
 likewise<LAB_VALUE> increased</LAB_VALUE> values of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> lactic py- ruvic acid</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> as a reflection of the higher values 
 of these substances in the mother.  the 
 formation of these products<SIGN_SYMPTOM> of metabolic breakdown</SIGN_SYMPTOM> by the fetus, however, was not 
 significantly increased.  after infusion of 
<MEDICATION> glucose insulin</MEDICATION>, the other investigated 
 parameter values, including those of the levels 
 of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> unesterified fatty acids</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> are found 
 in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cord blood</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> in similar amounts as after 
 infusion of glucose alone.  these re- 
 sults cannot reliably prove the passage of 
 insulin through the placenta especially 
 after a continued study of the metabolic values 
 in newborns.  as a proof of the passage 
 of insulin through the placenta could not be 
 established, it is possible that after an 
 intake of insulin the increase of unesterified 
 fatty acids in the cord blood could be 
 caused by a relative insufficiency of the insular 
 apparatus of the fetus.  the most 
 probable reason for the increase of unesterified 
 fatty acids is the different depo- 
 sition and metabolization of unesterified fatty 
 acids in the course of intrauterine 
 life.

 the authors discuss the classical concept of a<SIGN_SYMPTOM>gno recognize</SIGN_SYMPTOM> objects, when the functions of<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> sense organs</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> are undamaged.  the 
 psychological studies on perception and the modern<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> physiology vision</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and 
 to affirm their identity. <BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cortex recptors cortical sensorial sense organs</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> carried out by suitable means.  since we are 
 confronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate 
 dynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and 
 spatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and often 
 complex  a particular stress is laid on<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> local adaptation flicker fusion tachistoscopy</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> on account of their significance and suitability.  by such 
 methods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological 
 disturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of 
 visual recognition. <SIGN_SYMPTOM> fluctuation extinction alteration perception of movement</SIGN_SYMPTOM>, both real and<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> apparent light darkness</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which, 
 at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic' 
 behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot always 
 be explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a function 
 complementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptive 
 processes, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latest 
 neurophysiological data the attention is called to<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> ocular motility proprioceptivity</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>, centrifugal innervation of<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> sensorial receptors</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>, and 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> vestibularfference</SIGN_SYMPTOM>s.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance is 
 attached by the authors to the association of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> lateral</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><DISEASE_DISORDER> visual disturbances</DISEASE_DISORDER> with 
 altered<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> proprioceptive kinesthetic information</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> from the corresponding 
 half<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>-body</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factors 
 responsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  in 
 the light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitable 
 semeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their cases 
 into 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which altered

<DISEASE_DISORDER> cirrhosis of the liver</DISEASE_DISORDER>.  the figures refer to the age and sex of the patients, 
 as well as to the etiology and the hepatic morphology.  as the date of death of 
 304 of the subjects was known, it was possible to calculate the survival time 
 after the diagnosis was made.  only<LAB_VALUE> 36</LAB_VALUE>% survived the time of diagnosis by<DATE> 1 year</DATE>,<LAB_VALUE> 16</LAB_VALUE>% by<DATE> 3 years</DATE>, and<LAB_VALUE> 8</LAB_VALUE>% by<DATE> 5 years</DATE>.  these figures show that modern 
 therapy of liver<DISEASE_DISORDER> cirrhosis</DISEASE_DISORDER> has up to now not succeeded to prolong the life of 
 the majority of the victims.  in many cases, however, it is possible to a large 
 extent to relieve the patients' suffering by improving the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> appetite condition</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> and by eliminating<SIGN_SYMPTOM> ascites hemorrhage stupor</SIGN_SYMPTOM>.  particular attention should be paid to the prophylaxis of the disease 
 and, by studying the survival time assessments and therapeutic reports, to the 
 method of selection of the subjects.

 animals on<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> prolonged</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> drug therapy are<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> immunologically</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> competent</SIGN_SYMPTOM>; drug therapy

 prolonged survival because the<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> second donor kidney double</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 dose of antigen is<SIGN_SYMPTOM> rejected</SIGN_SYMPTOM> while the first continues to survive; absorption or 
 metabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results because 
 two kidneys, each<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> from separate donors</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>, can be rejected differentially in the

 additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female, 
 are<SIGN_SYMPTOM> fertile</SIGN_SYMPTOM> and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalized

 the clinical significance of this phenome-

 these studies re-emphasize the limita-

 demand investigation in regard to their

 in several pathologic conditions.  it is more logical 
 to measure the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> cardiac output</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>

 this is valid if the collimator covers

 to be shown if such a calculation 
 is valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, through 
 which the radioactive material

 the rational for using<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> hypothermia</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> or 
<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cerebral</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> dehydration</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> is to suppress or re- 
 verse<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> progressive</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> or delayed<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cerebral</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> damage</SIGN_SYMPTOM> after<DISEASE_DISORDER> hypoxia</DISEASE_DISORDER>.  it is suggested that 
 damage of this nature results from injury 
 to the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> astroglia oligodendroglia</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>,

 clinical evidence favors lowering of the 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> body temperature</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> immediately after any 
 episode of<DISEASE_DISORDER> hypoxia</DISEASE_DISORDER> accompanied by impor- 
 tant<SIGN_SYMPTOM> damage</SIGN_SYMPTOM> to the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> brain</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.  the rational 
 for using dehydration is insecure and its 
 results are uncertain.  this treatment 
 should probably be reserved for cases in

 the aim of hypothermia is protection of vital

 during aneurysm repair; profound hypothermia 
 is also valuable in operating on 
 certain<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cardiac</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> defects which cannot be repaired 
 even with whole body perfusion. 
 since the time needed for aneurysm repair often 
 exceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12

 hypothermia of 29  to 30  c., the

 the data are compatible with other indica-

 there is suppression of initial uptake of

 increase in the uptake of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> h3tdr</SIGN_SYMPTOM> into the 
<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> dna large thymocytes</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.  this finding, 
 which is in agreement with the previous 
 findings of sugino et al. suggesting transfer 
 of thy<SIGN_SYMPTOM>mine</SIGN_SYMPTOM> nucleotides from small thy- 
 mus lymphocytes to<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> precursor</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cells, may or 
 may not be related to the apparent 
 transfer of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> dna</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> label</SIGN_SYMPTOM> between<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> thy</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>mic cells. 
 the evidence for the latter consists of 
 the curvilinear dilution of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> dna label</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> in 
 the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> thymus cell</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> population 
 and the relationship between the rate of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> dna label</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> dilution in large cells and the 
 dna in the small cells in the thymus.  after 
 the dna label in progenitor cells in 
 the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> thymus nodes small dividing cells</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> follows 
 the same slope as the loss of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> radio- activity</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> from the entire<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> lymph node</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.  there is a 
 long retention of some<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> h3dna label</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> 
 in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> dividing lymph node cell</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> population.  this 
 suggests that the loss of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> radioacti- vity</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> from the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> dividing cells</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and from the small 
 cell population as a whole occurs e- 
 qually.  this pattern prevails regardless of 
 whether the percentage of large and 
<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> small</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> cells is altered experimentally.  these 
 findings can be explained by an inter- 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> change</SIGN_SYMPTOM> of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> dna nuclear</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> label between small 
 lymphocytes and large lymphocytes. 
 this could occur by some process such as 
 phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans- 
 formation of the small lymphocyte into a large, 
 dividing cell.  the data fit best with 
 the latter possibility.  all or any of these 
 mechanisms would lead to an equilibration 
 of the dna label between large and small 
 cells.  this finding prevents the assign- 
 ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on 
 the basis of dna labeling kinetics.  ne- 
 vertheless, there appear to be at least two 
 different types of lymphocytes.  one,

 in<DISEASE_DISORDER> breast cancer</DISEASE_DISORDER> patients at different

 patients.  this is in agreement with 
 the clinical impression that these easily tolerated 
 small doses of<MEDICATION> corticosteroids</MEDICATION> have 
 the same therapeutic effect as adrenalectomy in 
 patients with breast cancer.  the

7364. experimental<SIGN_SYMPTOM> amyloidosis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in immunity 
 much of interest in the mechanism of 
 experimental amyloidosis as a result of the 
 parenteral introduction of foreign protein 
 has been centered around the nature of 
 the links leading to cytological and biochemical 
 changes in<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> tissues body fluids</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>. 
 some of the authors suggested that such links 
 may be of immunological nature. 
 there is however, no clear-cut proof either 
 in favor of or against the theory of an 
 immunological origin of amyloid.  since 
 injection of<MEDICATION> proteins</MEDICATION> during the perinatal 
 period prevents an immune response when 
 the animal is subsequently challenged 
 with the same antigen, the authors studied 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> amyloidosis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> caused by case<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>in</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> in mice 
 treated<DATE> after birth soon after birth</DATE> to case<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>in</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> ac-

 developed<SIGN_SYMPTOM> amyloidosis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> to the same extent. 
 the results imply that the pathogenesis of 
 amyloidosis does not rest upon a classic 
 immunological basis; they do not exclude 
 the possibility, that the disease may be 
 due to some auto-immune process.

2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and their 
 parts. ii. bacterial cytoplasm 
 comparison of the fine structure of the 
 cytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that of 
 the 'cell in general' reveals important 
 differences leading to the conclusion that, in 
 the bacterial cytoplasm, there is little 
 differentiation into separate functional en- 
 tities.  there is no nuclear membrane, and 
 fine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo- 
 plasm into the cytoplasm where they may 
 expand in all directions.  the cytoplasm is not 
 necessarily intersected by membranous 
 profiles of special configuration, as is borne 
 out by e. coli b and other gram-negative 
 organisms.  when membranous profiles 
 of special configuration are present, as 
 in the gram-positive b. subtilis, these 
 do not appear differentiated into clearly 
 definable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi 
 substance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria. 
 as for kinetosomes, the presence 
 of centrioles is perhaps not very likely.  the 
 experiments in which tellurite is re- 
 duced in the cells suggest that there are 
 structures at the base of the flagella with 
 reductive capacity.  however, upon application 
 of the<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> tetranitro-blue tetrazolium</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 technic to b. subtilis, these are not stained. 
 they are presumably identical with 
 basal granules.  the membranous structures 
 in b. subtilis are called chondrioids 
 by the author because probably one of their 
 functions is that they are the sites of 
 the respiratory enzyme chain.  in the 
 gram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable site 
 of the respiratory chain has a structure 
 very different from that in the bacillus; it 
 is not clear whether membranes are 
 involved in their structure.  morphologically, 
 even in b. subtilis chondrioids differ 
 fundamentally from the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> mitochondria</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> in that 
 they are not built up<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> from composite membranes of plasma membrane</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>, and they may not be completely 
 closed systems.  regarding this last 
 point, it was observed that chondrioids may 
 possibly stand in open connection with 
 the cell's environment, since its lumen is not 
 separated from the cell wall by a 
 plasma membrane.  although as yet nothing is 
 known about this, it does not seem to 
 be precluded that these membranous organelles 
 may function also as intracellular 
 transport systems.  contrary to porter's ideas 
 about er, the chondrioids are not 
 extensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the 
 plasma membrane.  on the other hand, 
 they are in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> nuclear area nucleoplasm chromatophore vesicle</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> is of a<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> simple structure membrane single membrane</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> and 
 thus resembles the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> granum disc</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>, but it is much 
 smaller.  in tissue cells, an im- 
 portant function of the er is the support of protein 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> synthesis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> by ribosomes bound 
 to their surfaces.  evidence is now accumulating 
 that the active complexes for<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> poly- peptide</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> synthesis</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in bacteria are also membrane<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-bound series of 70s ribo- somes the same messenger rna moleculeplast diluted crude fixing media</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>, and identified

 makes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmic 
 details an intriguing prospect from 
 which much fundamental information can be 
 gained.  the organizational pattern on 
 the ultrastructural level in bacteria reveals 
 fundamental similarities and divergen- 
 cies from that in the 'cell in general'.

 geny of transformed cells are also consistent 
 with the model of independent incorpo- 
 ration of both dna strands.  some calculations 
 were done on the probability of the 
 integration of a single dna strand carrying a 
 particular genetic marker, and on the 
 probability of recombination leading to double transformants.

 the reproduction of bacteriophages requires 
 the participation of bacterial metabol- 
 ism.  synthesis of the viral protein components 
 is accomplished by the same me- 
 chanism as ordinarily produces bacterial 
 proteins; however, for the synthesis of 
 nucleic acids (dna or r<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>na</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>) enzymes may 
 be required which are not present in non- 
 infected bacteria; their formation is then 
 induced by the virus itself.  the fundamental 
 biological processes of replication, transcription 
 and translation are discussed in

 synthesis of his<SIGN_SYMPTOM>tidase</SIGN_SYMPTOM> (<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>l-histidine am- monia lyase</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>) in b. subtilis was investigated. 
 it was found that induced cells poisoned 
 with<MEDICATION> actinomycin</MEDICATION>, an inhibitor of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> rna synthesis</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>, 
 lose their capacity for the forma- 
 tion of a protein precursor of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> histidase te</SIGN_SYMPTOM>in synthesis.  the possibility has not been 
 excluded that the inducer exerts its 
 effect by bringing about the stabilization of 
 the messenger rna that is still attached 
 to dna or has not yet become attached to 
 ribosome<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>s</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.  alternatively, the inducer may 
 actually stimulate the synthesis of 
 histidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver- 
 sion of the precursor to active enzyme 
 appears to involve polymerization of mono- 
 mers, rather than the release of 
 ribosome-bound inactive enzyme.

<SIGN_SYMPTOM> deterioration deletion</SIGN_SYMPTOM> of

 previously described in the literature that extensive 
 inactivation leads to a state 
 of dna, apparently more resistant than the initial one. 
 inactivation does not con- 
 firm to exponential kinetics.  the authors discuss the 
 coding mistake hypothesis 
 as an explanation for this remarkable fact.  extensive 
 hno2 or uv light action re- 
 sults in multiple lesions in the dna<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> molecule</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and

4854. on the formation of object<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>-</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>relations and identifications of the 
 kibbutz child 
 some of the issues relevant to the early 
 stages of object relation formation and 
 identification of kibbutz children are 
 discussed.  for this purpose the child rearing 
 milieu of the kibbutz child is described 
 and some clinical illustrations are given. 
 the relationship to the mother is seen 
 as the main object-relation and those to the 
<HISTORY> educators</HISTORY> as<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> transient-interchangeable need-satisfying</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> relationships.  on the basis 
 of retrospective analytical material it 
 appears that in the course of development 
 the two relations as well as the two 
 respective, originally distinct, object represen- 
 tations are synthetised into one.  the 
 conditions of communal education, character- 
 ised by double object-relation formation 
 from birth on, are seen as factors that in- 
 tensify the 'normative crisis of infancy', 
 especially the transition from the symbio- 
 tic to the separation-individuation stage 
 of object-relation development.

2953. the death of a<FAMILY_HISTORY> parent</FAMILY_HISTORY> 
 in the case of depressive illnesses the death 
 of either<HISTORY> parent</HISTORY> prior to the child reach- 
 ing the<DATE> age of 15</DATE> seemed to be correlated 
 as a significant contributory factor.  with 
 this exception, statistical studies suggest 
 that it is the death of a mother in the first 
<DURATION> 7 yr.</DURATION> of a child's life, as opposed to that 
 of a father, that is potentially an etiologi- 
 cal factor for the future development of 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> psychoses</SIGN_SYMPTOM>, delinquency and psychoneuroses. 
 the case histories of 6 boys who had lost 
 their<FAMILY_HISTORY> fathers</FAMILY_HISTORY> were given.  in each instance 
 there was distinct evidence that the<SIGN_SYMPTOM> psychological</SIGN_SYMPTOM> 
 symptoms and behavioral disturb- 
 ances were to be attributed in large measure 
 to the effect of the death upon the child, 
 and that in some cases the symptom choice was 
 to be correlated with specific cir- 
 cumstances surrounding the death of the father. 
 in some cases it was the unresolved 
<DISEASE_DISORDER> grief reaction</DISEASE_DISORDER> in the mother which helped to 
 perpetuate the disorder in the child.  re- 
 solution of this in the mother during<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> therapy</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> 
 led to improvement in the child's func<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>-ing</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.  in other instances improvement 
 occurred especially when the child ceased 
 to be preoccupied with a close identification 
 with the<FAMILY_HISTORY> dead father</FAMILY_HISTORY>.  those boys who 
 were involved most closely in their mother's 
 grief reactions were the ones who were 
 most disturbed.  the brief<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> treatment</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> given 
 these boys and their mothers appeared 
 to be responsible for the considerable 
 amelioration of symptoms that resulted.  ther- 
 apeutic intervention is worthwhile, 
 especially in those instances where there is an 
 unresolved grief reaction in the mother.

1848. the child's concept of death 
 in this translation of a paper, which first 
 appeared in 1912, it is shown, according 
 to freud, how far a child's appreciation 
 of being dead differs from its true signifi- 
 cance.  death means a<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> reversible</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> decrease 
 in life<SIGN_SYMPTOM> functions</SIGN_SYMPTOM>, that can be interrupted 
 at any time, like sleep.  at other times it 
 may mean a temporary separation; but 
 always it is in man's power to change it. 
 in this concept, the child's unconscious 
 finds license for his sadism.  cruelty to 
 animals and death wishes against persons 
 close to him appear, in overcompensation, as 
 exaggerated pity for dead creatures 
 and the belief in man's power over life and death.

 characteristic subphases of this separation

 differentiation, the practicing period, association

 of mother and child throughout these

 material.  a poor relation between mother 
 and child in 1 subphase does not necessarily 
 or usually preclude impressive changes 
 for the better in the next subphase.

2906.<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> early</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><HISTORY> childhood separations</HISTORY> 
 every child in this long-term study of child 
 rearing showed significant<SIGN_SYMPTOM> reactions</SIGN_SYMPTOM> to 
 ordinary<HISTORY> separations</HISTORY> by about<DATE> 1 yr. of age</DATE>. 
 the similar pattern of response in this 
 group of children suggests a biologically 
 determined cause.  the<SIGN_SYMPTOM> clinging</SIGN_SYMPTOM> reaction 
 appeared when the child became mobile and 
 able<HISTORY> to move away from mother</HISTORY> re- 
 gardless of the frequency or duration of his 
 separations.  the majority of the mothers 
 did not understand this natural phenomenon 
 and regarded the<SIGN_SYMPTOM> clinging</SIGN_SYMPTOM> and crying of 
 the 1<AGE>-year</AGE>-old as evidence of spoiled or 
 regressed behavior.  the pediatrician can 
 be helpful to a mother by anticipating and 
 explaining separation responses, by indi- 
 cating their universality, and by giving 
 specific recommendations for gradual changes 
 to modify these reactions.

1808.<DISEASE_DISORDER> separation anxiety</DISEASE_DISORDER>  a factor in the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> object relations</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> of 
 schizophrenic patients. 
 the thesis is advanced that 
 special vulnerability to<DISEASE_DISORDER> separation anxiety</DISEASE_DISORDER> is a crucial 
 factor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishing 
 and maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships. 
 2 major reasons for this are lack of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> autonomy constancy</SIGN_SYMPTOM>.  without a stable autonomous 
 capacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi- 
 nately dependent upon others for help, protection, and 
 direction.  without object constancy, he is unable to 
 maintain a stable representation of the needed person in 
 the latter's absence.  evidence is presented from the 
 intensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients. 
 many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation- 
 ship center about the patient's separation anxiety and 
 his attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging, 
 perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to deny 
 separation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi- 
 nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reverse 
 passive victimization into active mastery.  the practical 
 implications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz- 
 ophrenic patients are discussed.

 seem to indicate that the aging processes, 
 of lenses as well as the development of 
 senile cataract are of a similar character, 
 but of different intensity.  (5) undoubtedly, 
 the processes of transition from<LAB_VALUE> slow fractions of soluble protein ones</LAB_VALUE> 
 and the transformation of part of the

1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity of 
 tocopherols 
 dietary selenium at levels below<DISTANCE> 1</DISTANCE> ppm has a partially beneficial effect 
 upon<DISEASE_DISORDER> nutritional muscular dystrophy</DISEASE_DISORDER> but is ineffective or detrimental 
 at higher levels.  the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness of 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> vitamin e</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increases 
 the retention of the a<SIGN_SYMPTOM>-tocopherolsa-to</SIGN_SYMPTOM>copherol.  this has been 
 shown by<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> chemical determination plasma tocopherols tritiated tocopherols selenium75</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> in<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> serum</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and in various 
 fractions of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> serum proteins se75 h3-a-tocopherol serum proteins</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.  these studies indicated that vitamin e may be 
 carried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin.  thus, 
 one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containing 
 compound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function in 
 absorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer across 
 cell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activity 
 in the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.

266. immunology of the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cancer</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> cell: tumour-specific antigens 
 after a broad historical survey of immunological 
 studies of cancer, a review is given 
 of the evidence showing that antigens present in 
 normal cells are missing from the 
 malignant cells that arise from the same tissue. 
 this evidence is considered in con- 
 junction with the deletion hypothesis of carcinogenesis, 
 and the author emphasizes, 
 that in his view, the key event in carcinogenesis 
 is enzymatic deletion.  antigenic 
 gain and intensification in the course of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> spontaneous chemical viral-</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 genesis is reviewed, together with experiments 
 demonstrating the existence of 
 tumour-specific antigens.  the question is then 
 posed: if tumours have specific<SIGN_SYMPTOM> anti</SIGN_SYMPTOM><DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>

 gression points to host resistance but its rarity 
 suggests that tolerance generally 
 develops.  consideration is given to the 
 application of<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> immunological methods</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> to 
 therapy and although current achievement 
 in this field is limited, new immunological 
 stratagems might yet transform the picture. 
 finally a plea is made for the integra- 
 tion of the disciplines of immunology and 
 cellular differentiation.  the prospect is 
 raised that through a synthetic and holistic 
 approach we might discover the suscepti- 
 bility of the cancer cell to re-<SIGN_SYMPTOM>different</SIGN_SYMPTOM>iation 
 and re-recognition.

the aetiology and treatment of 
 urinary<SIGN_SYMPTOM> calculus calculus</SIGN_SYMPTOM> formation is 
 primarily a process of crystallization from super<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 saturated solutions rather than one of adsorption 
 on a specific protein matrix, as has been postulated 
 by boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king, 
 1963).  that crystallization is the primary factor 
 is strongly suggested by the recent studies of 
 vermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authors 
 produced artificial<SIGN_SYMPTOM> concretions</SIGN_SYMPTOM> which closely 
 resembled<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> urinary</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><SIGN_SYMPTOM> calculi</SIGN_SYMPTOM> by immersing a<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> rotating wire loop normal urine</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> for<DURATION> several days</DURATION> and 
 slowly adding the appropriate stone-forming 
 elements. 
 if the above hypothesis is correct then the 
 factors of primary interest in urinary stone 
 formation are those responsible for supersaturation, 
 nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remains 
 to be learnt about these various factors, their 
 inter-relationships, and their relative importance. 
 the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins, 
 muco<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-protein</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>s and polysaccharides) in calculus 
 formation is still not clear but it is probable that 
 they play an important secondary role in binding 
 crystalline precipitates to form a non-<SIGN_SYMPTOM>friable</SIGN_SYMPTOM> 
 calculus.  since time is an important factor in 
 crystal growth such non-specific binding by 
 proteins would increase the chances of stone 
 growth and retention within the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> upper urinary tract</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.

 thus these effects may not be so uniquely a measure of the biological

<SIGN_SYMPTOM> human growth hormone</SIGN_SYMPTOM> may be detected 
 in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> serum</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> through the use of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> radio- immunoassay</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.  the hypothalamus is inti- 
 mately involved with the control of the 
 secretion and release of growth hormone 
 from the pituitary.  there is a correlation 
 between the availability of glucose for me- 
 tabolism and the plasma concentration of 
 growth hormone; when glucose is unavail- 
 able growth hormone is released in order to 
 provide a substitute source of energy, fatty 
 acids. 
 the administration of<MEDICATION> growth hormone</MEDICATION> 
 to the patient with<DISEASE_DISORDER> hypopituitarism</DISEASE_DISORDER> is fol- 
 lowed by<SIGN_SYMPTOM> growth</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in many instances, but it 
 has not usually been effective in promoting 
 growth in individuals with other abnormali- 
 ties.  acquired resistance to the effect of 
 growth hormone is accompanied by the de- 
 velopment of antibodies directed against 
 this<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> protein</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.

insulin and<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> protein protein synthesis</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> within cells has 
 been outlined. <SIGN_SYMPTOM> protein</SIGN_SYMPTOM> is formed in the absence of insulin; 
 the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin.  the 
 effects of insulin on<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> protein metabolism</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> take place independently 
 of the transport of glucose or amino acids into the 
 cell; of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> glycogen energy phosphate</SIGN_SYMPTOM> formation.  in the case of<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> protein glucose</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> fat</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellular 
 effects of insulin in many tissues.  within most 
 tissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantly 
 at the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> microsomal</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> level.  incidentally, other 
 hormones which affect protein metabolism such as<DISEASE_DISORDER> growth</DISEASE_DISORDER> 
 or<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> sex hormones</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> appear to act at the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> microsomes</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>.  the fact 
 that insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at other 
 intracellular sites as well as the above independent effects 
 leads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulation 
 of multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events. 
 the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on protein 
 synthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellular 
 glucose or amino acids does not mean that the 
 sustained functioning of cells is likewise independent.  the 
 biochemist is fully aware of<DISEASE_DISORDER> metabolic defects</DISEASE_DISORDER> in diabetes 
 which are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demand 
<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> varying</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> periods of pretreatment of the animal.  it is 
 also known that in diabetes some<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> proteinsenzyme</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>s) may 
 be deficient while others may be produced in excess in the 
 absence of insulin. 
 it is suggested that the physician desires at least two 
 kinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his 
 patients.  one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulin 
 action to pathological processes in tissues which have 
 not as yet been examined by the methods described.  the 
 other is the need for more accurate measurements of the 
 metabolic disorder and its control than such things as 
 urinary and blood glucose.  in developing such future improvements, 
 the place of insulin in protein biosynthesis 
 must be kept in mind.

on<DISEASE_DISORDER> language disorders</DISEASE_DISORDER> in young children: a reorganization of thinking 
 current questions and confusions about 
 the use of the term aphasia with reference 
 to young children seem often to 
 reflect semantic problems accruing 
 from professional habits of thinking in 
 terms of etiologic and pathologic labels. 
 it is argued that if the term aphasia is 
 generalized simply to refer to in<SIGN_SYMPTOM>abilities comprehension</SIGN_SYMPTOM> and use, then 
 it is the task of an evaluating group to 
 describe as well as possible, and in detail, 
 the specific impairments of function 
 in each child.  this task commonly 
 requires the use of an extensive period 
 of "diagnostic teaching," wherein care 
 is taken to explore which<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> sensory</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> and 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> motor of stimuli</SIGN_SYMPTOM> is taking place. 
 some current ideas are discussed with 
 reference to descriptions of impairment, 
 causal factors that are fairly unique in 
 childhood, some thoughts about the 
 neurophysiology of the human "language 
 system," and some psychosocial 
 factors important for language-learning. 
 special attention is given to various relations, 
 in terms of temporal resolving 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> power</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>, between<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> sensation</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and<SIGN_SYMPTOM> sensory</SIGN_SYMPTOM> 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> integration</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.  a scheme, or model, is suggested 
 which may prove fruitful for 
 experimental design in attacking some 
 of these problems at a prelanguage or 
 premeaning level.  it is argued that the 
 proportion of "unknowns" can be reduced 
 by careful study based on information 
 about impaired functions within the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> sensory-integrative-motor complex</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE>, 
 without particular regard for "site and 
 extent of lesion."

the formation of a cleft palate unit- a preliminary report

 ironically the problem of congenital defects increases as 
 our competence to deal with them advances.  in the past

interpretation within the metaphor 
 analytic investigation of the use of the metaphor was first given impetus 
 by ella freeman sharpe (1950), who explored the symbolic 
 meaning of particular metaphoric phrases with reference to the body 
 and libidinal needs.  currently, interest has become focused upon the 
 use of the metaphor as a self-conscious, rational therapeutic technique 
 of communication, of particular value with those patients who have 
 reached "the borderline of sanity".  ekstein (1961) and ekstein and 
 wall<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>er</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>stein (1957) have emphasized that the use of the metaphor 
 should be regarded as an essential technique for gradually establishing 
 communication and initial insight with borderline and schizophrenic 
 patients but that it must not be regarded as a treatment technique 
 in itself.  it is but a preliminary approximation to the final therapeutic 
 act, which ultimately will consist of a classical interpretation 
 at the level of the secondary process.  the use of the metaphor derives 
 its primary value from maintaining contact with patients who are 
 constantly in danger of being inundated by a break-through of primary- 
 process material.

early experience and the socialization of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> cognitive</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> modes in children 
 this paper deals with the question: what is<DISEASE_DISORDER> cultural</DISEASE_DISORDER> deprivation and how 
 does it act to shape and depress the resources of the human mind?  the 
 arguments presented are: first, that the behavior which leads to social, 
 educational, and economic poverty is socialized in early childhood; second, 
 that the central quality involved in the effects of cultural deprivation is a 
 lack of cognitive meaning in the mother-child communication system; and, third, 
 that the growth of cognitive<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> processes</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> is fostered in family control systems 
 which offer and permit a wide range of alternatives of action and thought and 
 that such growth is constricted by systems of control which offer predetermined 
 solutions and few alternatives for consideration and choice. 
 the research group was composed of 160 ne<AGE>gro</AGE><BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> mothers</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> and their 
<AGE> 4-year-old</AGE> children selected from four different social status levels. 
 the data are presented to show social status differences among the 
 four groups with respect to cognitive functioning and<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> linguistic</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> codes and 
 to offer examples of relations between maternal and child behavior that are 
 congruent with the general lines of argument laid out.

 the administration of<MEDICATION> testosterone propionate</MEDICATION> to<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> old</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> mice during compen-

 the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-induced 
 aging," is that x-irradiation of the<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> female</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> swiss mouse early in life does not 
 have a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-

 reduced<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> na excretion</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> during<DURATION> 2 hours</DURATION> in 
 the upright posture can occur in the 
 absence of circulating aldosterone, but 
 the abnormal magnitude of the na re-

 believed that the antidiuretic action is 
 dependent on the chlorothiazide-induced 
 saluresis.  although the mechanism of 
 this antidiuresis has not been clearly de- 
 fined, it seems best explained by postu- 
 lating a decrease in<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> filtrate</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> reaching the 
<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> distal nephron</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> (giving a<LAB_VALUE> decreased</LAB_VALUE><DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> final urine volume</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>) coupled with inhibition of

 mally seen, accounting for the increase 
 in<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> urine</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> concentration).  the possible 
 role of the mineralocorticoids in the

 ministration of<MEDICATION> sodium</MEDICATION><DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-retaining</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><MEDICATION> steroids</MEDICATION>

 zide was not altered by<MEDICATION> adrenal</MEDICATION><THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE>ectomy</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE>

 geographical differences need to be taken into account when making 
 physiological deductions about turnover of bone<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> salt</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> from changes with age in 
 the level of stable sr. 
 when children in the south-east of england and the rest of the united kingdom

 it seems that only a small proportion of malformations of

 terms and that most are dependent, to some extent at least, 
 on environmental factors.  the nature of these has yet to be

<FAMILY_HISTORY> relatives children</FAMILY_HISTORY> had some genetic factor which modifies the intra- 
 uterine environment and thus predisposes the embryo to these 
 malformations.  such a hypothesis opens up interesting 
 possibilities, but before accepting it one would have to be 
 satisfied that the higher incidence in maternal relatives is 
 not merely due to the fact that the history is obtained in 
 most cases from the mother.

a probable epidemic of<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> congenital</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>

 a peak in the incidence of<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> congenital</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> hydrocephalus</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in 1940-<DATE>41</DATE> is described; 
 reasons are given for believing it to be a genuine phenomenon, though it is too 
 late to find the cause. 
 epidemics of malformations are to be detected promptly only if the incidence 
 of malformations in a defined population is studied continuously; and for some 
 epidemics the population studied must be very large indeed.

 analysis of the form of the skull is

 base apparently is more closely related to 
 facial and general somatic growth than to 
 neural growth.

 the importance of monitoring programs 
 to record the occurrence of congenital 
<DISEASE_DISORDER> malformations</DISEASE_DISORDER> at group (for example, 
 hospital) and community (especially

 ing malformations and utilizing the 
 data for service programs or, better 
 still, for prevention, is not new, but 
 the methodical use of vital statistics 
 in a scientifically constructed surveil- 
 lance system is new.  so also is the 
 joint endeavor on the part of clinicians, 
 public health workers and basic scien- 
 tists to reconstruct an epidemiology of 
 deformity on the basis of time, place, 
 person distributions of malformations. 
 a primary need has been for stand-

 appreciable amount of<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> igg gm groups</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> identical with those of the<LAB_VALUE> mother</LAB_VALUE> 
 (68-70).  the level of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> igg</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> of the neonate decreases gradually during<DURATION> the first 3 months</DURATION> (3,27,71), which is generally explained by the catabolism of 
 the maternal igg, whereas the formation by the newborn infant is still 
 inadequate to maintain the original level (16,27).  the best evidence for the 
 transplacental passage is the almost complete absence of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> igg</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> serum newborn</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> infants from mothers with<DISEASE_DISORDER> agammaglobulinemia</DISEASE_DISORDER> (3,27).

palliation by<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> radiotherapy</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> 
 the purpose of radiotherapy in the management

 second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-

 the care of the patient with "incurable"<DISEASE_DISORDER> cancer</DISEASE_DISORDER> may be 
 directed by physicians of various backgrounds and per- 
 suasions.  if this physician has little experience in such 
 care, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti- 
 tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustified 
 premature claims for widely publicized methods recent on 
 the scene.  surgery and<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> radiation</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> therapy remain the 
 dominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  it 
 is unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiation 
 therapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the method 
 rather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient's 
 welfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapy 
 must be allowed indications and contraindications like any 
 therapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility of 
 the therapeutic radiologist.  application of realistically 
 stringent indications and contraindications does not lessen 
 useful accomplishment, but avoids unnecessary morbidity, 
 waste of time, money and effort, and delay in seeking 
 suitable treatment.

clues in dealing with 
 cancer patients 
 it is clear that the patient with cancer changed 
 his pattern of communication at different stages of 
 the disease.  these patterns in communication were 
 the basis or clues for the doctor and paramedical 
 personnel to consider in making total care more 
 effective.  the bedside clinician of past days knew 
 these clues instinctively in his wise ministrations. 
 thanks to a gifted social worker these have been 
 now made manifest to help all of us in dealing 
 with cancer and perhaps other chronic relentless 
 diseases.

on early infantile psychosis. 
 the symbiotic and autistic syndromes 
 in conclusion, i wish to state that the 
 core of child psychosis must 
 be sought in one or the other of the 
 described distortions of the sym- 
 biotic phase.  in the first case, what lay 
 at the heart of the psychotic dis- 
 turbance was the marked emotional 
 unavailability of the mother, 
 which alternated with a purely<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> physical attacks</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>. 
 the contrasting experiences 
 drove the child to the autistic warding 
 off of any human contact and 
 the de-animation of the world of reality. 
 constitutional factors could 
 not, in this case, be evaluated with any 
 degree of accuracy. 
 in the second case, it was, by contrast, 
 the mother's ever-presence 
 that created an unendurable instrusion 
 upon and interference with 
 the structuralization of the budding ego, 
 which constitutionally and 
 perhaps predispositionally may have been 
 very vulnerable.  this made 
 it impossible for the infant to experience 
 the normal alternation of 
 the gratification<SIGN_SYMPTOM>-frustrationation</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in the 
 separation-individuation period 
 one which was beset with abysmal panic. 
 in both instances, we can see that it was 
 primarily in the severe dis- 
 tortions of the normal symbiosis that the 
 child psychosis had its roots.

evaluation and treatment planning 
 for autistic children 
 infantile autism is considered to be a re- 
 action on the part of an immature organism 
 at a primitive and undifferentiated stage of 
 ego development.  little choice of defensive 
 reactions is available; the possibility of sub- 
 limation does not exist and, even though 
 other object relationships are gradually 
 developing, the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> mother</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> is still the child's 
 primary object.  at this vulnerable develop- 
 mental stage, a wide range of pathological 
 circumstances, ranging from the most severe 
 family psychopathology to the most adventi- 
 tious physiological traumata or the most un<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 fortunately malignant circumstances, may 
 constitute an acute or cumulative<DISEASE_DISORDER> cata</DISEASE_DISORDER>- 
 strophic stress.  the primitive organism 
 tends to respond to this overwhelming stress 
 with a<SIGN_SYMPTOM> paranoid reaction</SIGN_SYMPTOM> which is directed at 
 the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> mother</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> (regardless of the actual etiologi- 
 cal variables) because the mother is still the 
 child's primary object.  we believe that the 
 child then responds with an<SIGN_SYMPTOM> autistic reaction with- drawal obsessional behavior</SIGN_SYMPTOM>,<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> magical de- lusional</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><SIGN_SYMPTOM> thought processes disruption</SIGN_SYMPTOM> of developmental skills, speech, 
 and relationships with others. 
 many families can and do make every 
 effort to counter the paranoid reaction of the 
 child and do not respond to his rejection with 
 counterrejection and counterwithdrawal. 
 some of the child's autistic symptoms may 
 abate without formal treatment.  yet, since 
 the mother (and family) are the primary 
 objects of the child's paranoid attitude, it is 
 felt that formal therapeutic intervention is 
 necessary to modify the paranoid core of 
 the autistic reaction.

 were acutely responsive to changes in their 
 environment, including the presence of the social

 subdivided into those who characteristically showed 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> stereotypies</SIGN_SYMPTOM> and those who did not, the

 was very similar to that of the normals,

 autistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of<SIGN_SYMPTOM> retreating from reality anxiety</SIGN_SYMPTOM> which forces withdrawal from social contact. 
 such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the age 
 range of<DATE> one to five years</DATE>.  a sense of security which is considered es- 
 sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love,<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> care approval</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> of those adults most closely associated with him.  when this 
 need is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self<SIGN_SYMPTOM>-realization anxiety</SIGN_SYMPTOM> may result.  the severity 
 of the anxiety may be the forerunner of a<DISEASE_DISORDER> schizophrenic- phrenia retardation</DISEASE_DISORDER>. 
 yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absence 
 of an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts with 
 other people.  a<SIGN_SYMPTOM> detachment</SIGN_SYMPTOM> of varying degrees persists where human 
 contacts are concerned.

 of spontaneity and involvement that is difficult to 
 attain with many group therapies, and it offers situa-

 minimal: the child can do what comes naturally.  in-

 the more advanced<DISEASE_DISORDER> renal failure</DISEASE_DISORDER> in the normocalcemic, 
 as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could mean 
 that the development of an effective degree of secondary 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> hyperparathyroidism</SIGN_SYMPTOM> is a function of the duration of the

 these disorders rarely have a 
 single cause.  they are the result of an 
 intermingling of many factors, some physiological 
 and some psychological, some 
 residing within the child and some in the 
 parents and environment in general. <SIGN_SYMPTOM> delayed speech</SIGN_SYMPTOM> is a cause for 
 great concern to most parents and teachers.

 is harmful.  while the worker 
 may not be in a position to offer specific 
 advice on a particular child, the manner 
 in which the parents and teacher are handling 
 the child's communication problem 
 can be explored and damaging practices 
 possibly eliminated.  the fact that there 
 may be a diagnostic and treatment center 
 to which the child can be referred does 
 not vitiate the public health worker's role.

the causes of delayed development of speech. 
 speech develops parallelly and simultaneously 
 with psychophysical development of 
 the child, arising from internal need and 
 under the influence of external factors.  not 
 all children are given the chance to develop 
 in favorable conditions and to pass through 
 all the phases of development without some 
 injury.  the various possibilities when a 
 child may be injured and hampered in the 
 development of speech are discussed.  the 
 testing<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> of the sense of hearing</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> in children 
 with a cleft<DISEASE_DISORDER> palate</DISEASE_DISORDER> is also included-out of 
 181 cases of cleft palate, in 72 cases there 
 was<LAB_VALUE> decrease</LAB_VALUE> of the<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> sense of hearing</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE><LAB_VALUE> exceeding 30 db</LAB_VALUE>.  this additional injury of 
 the child with a cleft palate, if remaining unnoticed, 
 may make the treatment of speech 
 abnormality difficult.  the necessity of 
 diagnostic team investigation and the treatment 
 of children with speech disturbances 
 are emphasized.

 been born recently and that they enlarge 
 during the<DURATION> following 48 hr.</DURATION> before they enter

 this technique of cancer therapy is 
 effective for palliation of many advanced primary

<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> head neck</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><DISEASE_DISORDER> cancer</DISEASE_DISORDER> patients form the largest 
 group of patients that have been treated 
 because of the easily accessible arteries. 
 however, almost any involved organ 
 can be infused by external approaches to the

 most<MEDICATION> oncolytic chemotherapeutic agents</MEDICATION> can 
 be given via the<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> intra-arterial increased</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> dosages with the exception

 for<DURATION> 1</DURATION><DOSAGE> or 2 mth</DOSAGE>.  the best therapeutic results 
 have been in patients with head and neck 
 and<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> pelvic</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> tumors.  currently infusion techniques 
 using small<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> mobile pumping units</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION> 
 permit the patient to be ambulatory during course

 administration of the same<MEDICATION> steroids progesterone</MEDICATION> to nursing mothers 
 results in<SIGN_SYMPTOM> hyperbili</SIGN_SYMPTOM><DISEASE_DISORDER>rubinemia</DISEASE_DISORDER> of their infants. 
 these facts explain the pathogenesis 
 of neonatal<SIGN_SYMPTOM> jaundice</SIGN_SYMPTOM>.  interpretation of the 
 experimental and clinical findings leads 
 to the conclusion that the high amount of 
 steroid hormones which must be excreted 
 during the neonatal period in conjunction 
 with the relative insufficiency of the neonatal 
 liver is responsible for the inability 
 to conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid. 
 the steroid hormones probably compete 
 with bilirubin for the enzyme and substrate 
 necessary for conjugation.  the functional 
 capacity of the neonatal liver is 
 not high enough to conjugate both bilirubin 
 and steroids.  only after excretion of the 
 placental steroids does sufficient conjugation 
 of bilirubin become possible.  furthermore, 
 pregnanediol appears to inhibit the 
<DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE> enzyme glucuronyl transferase</DIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE>.  these 
 mechanisms show the importance of steroid 
 hormones in the pathogenesis of neonatal 
 jaundice and their importance as an 
 aggravating factor in the development of 
<SIGN_SYMPTOM> jaundice</SIGN_SYMPTOM> due to erythroblastosis.  these newly 
 developed concepts may have therapeutic 
 implications on which the author will 
 report at a later date.

<SIGN_SYMPTOM>hemorrhagic episodes</SIGN_SYMPTOM> in<DISEASE_DISORDER> hemophilia</DISEASE_DISORDER>: a<DURATION> 5</DURATION>-year prospective study. 
 medicosocial studies of hemophilia are of 
 particular clinical importance in allowing an assessment 
 of the likely course of the disease at different 
 ages and for differing grades of severity, and in 
 providing knowledge of which complications cause 
 the most disability, loss of education, and earning 
 capacity.  they also overcome the distorted clinical 
 impression of the disease which arises from the 
 recurrent admission of the same few severely affected 
 hemophiliacs.  owing to the considerable individual 
 variation in the number and severity of complications 
 in different hemophiliacs an accurate individual 
 prognosis can never be given.  in general, 
 however, the number of spontaneous episodes per 
 year decreases with age, while the severity of individual 
 episodes tends to increase, at least until 
 the<DATE> age of 21 yr</DATE>.  there is general agreement that 
 the bulk of hospital<SIGN_SYMPTOM> hem</SIGN_SYMPTOM><DISEASE_DISORDER>ophilic hemarthroses hemophilic arthropathy</DISEASE_DISORDER> 
 involves the<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> knee</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> more than it does any other joint. 
 the increased time spent in hospital per episode in 
 later life is in part at least due to the development 
 of relatively unstable weight<DETAILED_DESCRIPTION>-</DETAILED_DESCRIPTION><SIGN_SYMPTOM>bearing</SIGN_SYMPTOM> joints due to 
<DISEASE_DISORDER> hemophilic arthropathy</DISEASE_DISORDER> and associated<BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE> muscle</BIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE><SIGN_SYMPTOM> atrophy</SIGN_SYMPTOM>. 
 thus the correct management of individual 
 hemarthroses in childhood is of considerable importance, 
 and at the present time too little is known 
 of the best possible treatment for these episodes. 
 little is known of the pathological mechanisms of 
 hem<DISEASE_DISORDER>ophilic</DISEASE_DISORDER> arthropathy and whether it is the presence 
 of blood or its presence under tension which 
 leads to joint destruction.  thus opinions differ concerning 
 the routine admission of all hemarthroses 
 to hospital regardless of severity and also about the 
 advisability of<THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> joint aspiration</THERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE> in an attempt to avoid 
 the development of destructive arthropathy.  because 
 of the individual variation between patients, the 
 changes in the pattern of the disease with age, and 
 the difficulty of obtaining suitable control patients 
 these questions can be answered only by further 
 longterm prospective medicosocial studies.
